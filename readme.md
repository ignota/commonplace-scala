# Commonplace (Scala Spike)
![](mascot.gif)

Play 2.8 app using Scala 2. Tests connecting Neo4j's [Java OGM](https://neo4j.com/docs/ogm-manual/current) to Scala (cool) rather than Java (groady). Requires JDK version 11 and the latest Scala 2.x.

Good resources to check out:

- [Neo4j's OGM docs](https://neo4j.com/docs/ogm-manual/current)
- [Scala 2.8 Java Conversions](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections/conversions-between-java-and-scala-collections.html) (in particular, note the automatic translation of a Scala `Set` to a Java `Set`)
- [Play framework docs](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x/Home)
- [Akka framework docs](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/index.html) (Akka has [Scala 3 support](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/project/scala3.html) in beta and scales better than Play)
